# Libc.so.6
> Fupping */lib/libc.so.6

I accidentally deleted `/usr/lib/libc.so.6` while working on my [HackPack](https://github.com/owenCocjin/HackPack) project. This library is used by literally any default/standard binary that isn't a bash builtin.

#### Bash Builtins:
> These are only the builtins that I think are the most important. Check `man bash` in the <b>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</b> section for a list of all of them.
- `source`
- `alias`
- `cd`
- `echo`
- `exit`
- `export`
- `kill`
- `logout`
- `pwd`

#### NOT Bash Builtins:
> You're gonna be messed up without these commands
- `cp`
- `ln`
- `ls`
- `mkdir`
- `nano`
- `sudo`
