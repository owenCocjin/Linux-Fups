cannot execute: required file not found
During startup program exited with code 127.
I got this error while trying to run a binary for a CTF.
This error means your computer isn't the correct architecture to run the binary.
In my case I had a x64 arch, trying to run an x86 bin.
I found my solution for my Debian-based VM here: https://superuser.com/questions/435988/how-can-i-resolve-the-error-cannot-execute-binary-file
